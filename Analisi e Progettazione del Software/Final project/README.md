# Gym Management System

## Pre-Appello of 08/06/2023

**Gym Management System**

Based on the gym management system modeled in previous tasks, please refer to the diagrams provided in the *GitHub link* of your respective group (see section Pre Appello – Creation of Repositories for Groups Turn 1 / 2).

## New Features

The project introduces the following features:

1. **Booking History and Reporting**: The system administrator can view the booking history, generate charts, and export data based on parameters such as time intervals, type of membership, and customer type.

2. **VIP Customer**: Introduced the VIP customer category, a customer who pays a significantly higher fee for gym membership or has been loyal for at least 10 years. VIPs have a personal trainer at no extra cost and can enjoy all gym services.

3. **Promotional Memberships**: Introduced memberships with discounts for specific periods and time slots, offering savings opportunities to customers.

4. **Special Events**: Periodically organized for loyal and VIP customers, who can register for free (VIP only) or at a reduced price (loyal customers). A reminder is sent 24 hours before the event.

5. **Merchandising**: Introduced the online sale of branded products, with discounts for loyal customers (30%) and VIPs (45%).
